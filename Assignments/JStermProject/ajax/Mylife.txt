NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER | ONE OF O: THE OPRAH MAGAZINES TEN FAVORITE BOOKS OF THE YEAR | NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Harpers Bazaar.  

Gloria Steinem writer, activist, organizer, and inspiring leader now tells a story she has never told before, a candid account of her life as a traveler, a listener, and a catalyst for change. Includes Secrets, a new chapter!

When people ask me why I still have hope and energy after all these years, I always say: Because I travel. Taking to the road by which I mean letting the road take you changed who I thought I was. The road is messy in the way that real life is messy. It leads us out of denial and into reality, out of theory and into practice, out of caution and into action, out of statistics and into stories in short, out of our heads and into our hearts.

Gloria Steinem had an itinerant childhood. When she was a young girl, her father would pack the family in the car every fall and drive across country searching for adventure and trying to make a living. The seeds were planted: Gloria realized that growing up didnt have to mean settling down. And so began a lifetime of travel, of activism and leadership, of listening to people whose voices and ideas would inspire change and revolution.<br><br>
